## Instructions:

- Attached is a screenshot of a modal popup with some text on it
- When you click the “Add Stars” button on the modal, it hits an endpoint that returns a “star” as a JSON object 
- The endpoint is here - https://starscape.voltron-eng.com/failing-stars
- The modal keeps track of the last three stars retrieved and displays the names returned.  Please duplicate this functionality with a method of your choosing (cookies, localstorage, db, etc)
- Write Unit Tests and End-To-End Tests

### Extra Credit:
 - Use Redux for state management
 - Use SASS/SCSS
 - Don’t use a React boilerplate or create-react-app
 - Dockerize your code

## Solution

 - Create a React application from scratch 
 - Write a React component for modal
